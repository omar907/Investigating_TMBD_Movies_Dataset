# Investigating_TMBD_Movies_Dataset

TMDB movies dataset is a large data set that contains information about more than 10K movies produced from the year 1960 to the year 2015.

It's an interesting data because it gives us a lot of detailed features about those movies, for example original title, popularity_score, budget, revenue, director, cast, taglines, overviews, runtime, production company, release date/year, vote cout/average, genres, and some more. So, we can actually use a lot of interesting insights about those movies as we will see in the report.

To start investigating the data, we should ask some questions about to start cleaning and preparing the data to answer those questions. So, after my first look on the data, I choosed these 8 questions that I think anyone could ask about it when he hears about a movie data set.

These questions are:
1- Which genres are most popular from year to year?
2- Which combinations of genres are most popular from year to year?
3- What kinds of proerties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
4- Who are the top 10 production companies in terms of total earnings and the most popular movies produced in this dataset?
5- Who are the top 10 actors with the top popularity movies in this dataset?
6- Who are the top 10 directors with the top popularity movies in this dataset?
And the basic 2 questions that should be asked are:
7- Which are the Top 10 moives in terms of earnings in this dataset?
8- Which release year that has the best movies?

I hope that the answers to these questions give us a better intution about various features in this dataset

You will find the answers with details in the notebook.
